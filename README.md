## The app structure
Rift Wanderer uses `vue.js` with `webpack` to get access to vuejs' single-file-components and es6 syntax.
I chose not to include vuejs in the webpack transpiling process and used it as a global variable instead.

## building and running for development
build from the sources:
```bash
npm install
npm run build-home
```
run it:
```bash
npm start
```

## packaging and distribution
_This part of the work still has to be done. The only way to run it at the moment is to use node.js and `npm start`_
